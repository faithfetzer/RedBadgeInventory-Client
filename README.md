This is my final project for Eleven Fifty Web Development Program.

The project required creating a Node server and a React application, showing understanding of: 
-PostgreSql
-Express
-Node
-REST API‚Äôs
-Creating API endpoints
-React Basics
-Connecting server and client

TypeScript was implemented and Material UI was used for styling. 

The server repo can  be accessed at https://github.com/faithfetzer/RedBadgeInventory-Server

I created this to track my personal inventory of pottery that I make in my free time, and allow me to keep track of listings I have, whether on online marketplaces or in local store. 

This inventory manager was made for makers and artists to keep track of the items they have for sale and where they may have them listed, such as various online marketplaces, in local stores etc.
It also has a feature for buyers (primarily wholesale) to view what items are available for sale from all makers.
Feel free to create an account! If you are a buyer, you can always switch to maker later if you start creating your own product!

Admin users can manage other accounts (edit and delete), and allow other users access to admin level. If you are cloning the repo, you will need to set up an initial admin account in Postman.
